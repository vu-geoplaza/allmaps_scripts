Scripts to make the UBVU digitized map collection usable with https://github.com/allmaps

Test by using the raw url to a json annotations (for example https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vu-geoplaza/allmaps_scripts/main/annotations/ubvu_115.json) in the allmaps viewer:

https://viewer.allmaps.org/#data=data%3Atext%2Fx-url%2Chttps%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fvu-geoplaza%2Fallmaps_scripts%2Fmain%2Fannotations%2Fubvu_115.json

Note that a lot of the images will not be displayed right because the dimensions of the images in CONTENTdm are different from the originals used for the georeferencing. 
We are planning to update the images in CONTENTdm later this year.
